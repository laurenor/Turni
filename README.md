# Turni
Competitive video-gaming, otherwise known as "esports", is not all fun and games--without proper organization, a tournament with hundreds to sometimes even thousands of participants could become chaotic.  Turni aims to quell and prevent the chaos by providing tournament organizers with interactive venue maps, with data loaded from Challonge brackets, to automatically assign participants to tables and keep track of where participants are located.  Turni also eases the pressure on participants, who would usually have to listen closely for their names being called over a raucous tournament environment, by sending them text messages of where they should go when it is their turn to play.
